# React + Vite frontend, Node.js + Express backend, MONGODB database.
Here is video review on this website functionality by me:
https://youtu.be/FJOXMmdnTKc

This project is hosted on netlify (for frontend) and heroku (for backend). You can test this website
on my database and server using following link:
https://main--asparianpharmacy.netlify.app

However, if you want to start this project on your PC - download it. 
Open terminal, go to backend folder:
Create your .env file and connect your database to this env variable: MONGODB_URI="/link-to-your-database-connection/"
node seed.js - use this to create some sample data to database
node server.js - use this to start the project.

Note: i had only 2 days to build this project, so dont expect anything fantastic and be ready for bugs.
